The journey starts here (Initial commit) :)

1. Class diagram is persistent and is saved while object diagrams are not
persistent and are not saved.

2. When you create or delete classes or change the relationship,
it is either created or deleted

3. When you create or delete objects or change the relationship.

4. a tutor which acts as an instructor of the students

6. See if the value has rolled over by seeing if the minutes value is 0
if it is then add one increment to the hours object.

8.No the value stayed as 2 when I tried to set the value to 11.
It has exceeded the limit of 6 and so the value was not changed.

9. the limit is 10 and so the most you can add before it rolls over is 9

10. "Error: ')' or ',' expected" is the message i get

11. "Error: '.class' expected" is the message i get and this can be fixed
by removing the int in the brackets and only leaving the number

12.
